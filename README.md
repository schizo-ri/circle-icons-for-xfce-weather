xfce4-weather-icons
===================

Flat circular icons for xfce4-weather-plugin inspired by Numix and Flattr icons.

Installation:
- Copy folder to /usr/share/xfce4/weather/icons or ~/.config/xfce4/weather/icons
- Choose Flat-Circle in plugin Properties under Appereance tab

The set contains this sizes: 22x22, 48x48, 128x128. There is a folder with scalable svg icons if you wish to modify them easier. I used script for conversion and resizing, it is in the repository. 22x22 icons are little modified as I like more padding on my panel.
